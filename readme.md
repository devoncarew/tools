==================

Dart Tools for Eclipse:
a super light-weight, fast re-envisioning of Dart support in Eclipse.

## Goals
- fantastic, light-weight UI; design from the top down
- use existing functionality wherever possible; do not reinvent the wheel; makes expedient choices
- rely on Dart tooling where possible (stagehand, analysis server, pub, grinderâ€¦)

## And also:
- fast!
- concentrate on the text editing experience
- where existing Eclipse functionality exists, we use it
- do not worry about the 20% cases
- UI under automated test
- uses Google Analytics
